<!--#Data Workshop: ITP Fall 2014
- - - --->

<!--Data Visualization workshop at ITP. Fall 2014. This is the repository for parts 2 and 3.<br>
John Farrell's section (part 1) on data visualization in Processing can be found [here](https://github.com/jefarrell/dataWorkshop/).-->


<!--##Data Janitorialization

Before getting started, do these things:

1. Download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/).

2. Install the [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa) browser extension.

3. Sign up for an account at [enigma.io](http://enigma.io/).


In this section, we are using loading a dataset from enigma.io, finding a method for reducing the data into a smaller series in order to visualize it, and transforming the data into the ideal data type.

The final code for the workshop is in the [session 2 folder](https://github.com/bclifton/data_workshop_2014/tree/master/session2).

Links to the screen recordings will be posted here.

#ITP Unconference 2015
-

This workshop is divided into two sections: Data Janitorialization, and Data Visualization. Both sections will use JavaScript for development.



**Tools used:**<br>
Creating the framework for the app: [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/).<br>
Adding Libraries: [CDNJS.com](https://cdnjs.com/)<br>
Creating visualizations: [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)
<br>
<br>

What is D3 and what can it do?

It is a visualization "kernal", not a "library". D3 was designed to be more rudimentary than a library, and more like a tool set, so people can use it to create things the creators of the library never imagined.
- [Simple graphs](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery).
- [Incredibly complicated things](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock), like [Visualizing Algorithms](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/).
