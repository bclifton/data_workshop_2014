Data Visualization workshop at ITP. Fall 2014. This is the repository for parts 2 and 3.

John Farrell's section (part 1) on data visualization in Processing can be found [here](https://github.com/jefarrell/dataWorkshop/).

This workshop is divided into two sections: Data Janitorialization, and Data Visualization. Both sections will use JavaScript for development.

##Data Janitorialization

Before getting started, do these things:

1. Download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/).

2. Install the [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa) browser extension.

3. Sign up for an account at [enigma.io](http://enigma.io/).


In this section, we are using loading a dataset from enigma.io, finding a method for reducing the data into a smaller series in order to visualize it, and transforming the data into the ideal data type.

The final code for the workshop is in the [session 2 folder](https://github.com/bclifton/data_workshop_2014/tree/master/session2).

Links to the screen recordings will be posted here.
